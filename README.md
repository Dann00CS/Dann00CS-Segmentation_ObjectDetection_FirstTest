# Testing yolov7 and yolov7_mask models

The goal of this project was to test both frameworks and use pre-trained models to train a new model that would detect not only animals from the COCO dataset (the one used to train yolov7) but also other animals as an additional class in the classification problem. 

The animal I choose was monkeys using data from public dataset [Monkey, Cat and Dog Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tarunbisht11/yolo-animal-detection-small).

Here, in my personal portfolio, you can check an [interactive web tool](http://www.sierradaniel.com/mcd_yolo/) I developed to make inference on this new model.
