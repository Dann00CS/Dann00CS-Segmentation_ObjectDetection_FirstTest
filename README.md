# Testing yolov7 and yolov7_mask models

The aim of this project was to test both frameworks and use pre-trained models to train a new model to detect not only animals from COCO dataset (the one used to train yolov7) but other animals as an extra class in the classification problem. 

The animal I choose was monkeys using data from public dataset [Monkey, Cat and Dog Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tarunbisht11/yolo-animal-detection-small).

Here, in my personal portfolio, you can check an [interactive web tool](http://www.sierradaniel.com/mcd_yolo/) I developed to make inference on this model.
